## Technical Architecture

### RAG Service (`ragPersonaService.ts`)
```typescript
class RAGPersonaService {
  // Core functionality
  gatherInteractionHistory(contactId, userId): Promise<InteractionHistory>
  generatePersonaContext(contactId, userId): Promise<PersonaContext>
  createRAGPrompt(context): string
  findSimilarProfiles(contact, userId): Promise<any[]>
}
```

### Database Schema
- **customer_personas**: Stores generated personas with behavioral analysis
- **behavioral_patterns**: Pattern matching for similar customer types
- **interaction_embeddings**: Vector embeddings for similarity search
- **persona_generation_history**: Tracks generation methods and accuracy
- **industry_benchmarks**: Industry-specific behavioral benchmarks

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: Powers the persona generation with enhanced prompts
- **RAG Prompting**: Comprehensive context including interaction history, behavioral metrics, and industry benchmarks
- **Fallback Support**: Basic persona generation when interaction data is limited

## Usage Guide

### 1. Select Contact
Choose a contact from your CRM to analyze and generate a persona for.

### 2. Choose Generation Method
- **Basic**: Uses only contact information (name, company, email, etc.)
- **RAG Enhanced**: Analyzes full interaction history for accurate behavioral profiling

### 3. Analyze Interaction History (RAG Mode)
Click "Analyze Interaction History" to gather and process:
- All activities (calls, meetings, emails, tasks)
- Email engagement patterns (opens, clicks, replies)
- Deal progression and conversion data
- Comments and notes
- Shared files and documents

### 4. Review Behavioral Metrics
The system displays:
- **Total Interactions**: Complete interaction count
- **Email Engagement Rate**: Percentage of engaged emails
- **Average Response Time**: Communication responsiveness
- **Conversion Rate**: Deal success percentage
- **Data Quality Score**: Overall data completeness assessment

### 5. Generate Persona
Click "Generate RAG-Enhanced Persona" to create a comprehensive behavioral profile.

### 6. Review Results
The generated persona includes two tabs:
- **Generated Persona**: Complete persona with pain points, motivations, and recommendations
- **Behavioral Insights**: Detailed activity patterns and engagement metrics

## Data Quality Scoring

The system calculates a data quality score based on:
- **Interaction Volume** (up to 50 points): More interactions = better accuracy
- **Email Engagement** (20 points): Presence of email tracking data
- **Deal History** (20 points): Conversion and deal progression data
- **Pattern Recognition** (10 points): Identified communication patterns

## Industry Benchmarks

The system includes benchmarks for:
- **Technology**: Small (1-50), Medium (51-200), Large (200+) companies
- **Healthcare**: Across all company sizes
- **Finance**: Industry-specific engagement and cycle metrics

### Sample Benchmarks
- Email engagement rates: 22-36% depending on industry and company size
- Average deal cycles: 45-180 days based on industry and company size
- Response time expectations: 24-48 hours industry average

## API Integration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Database Setup
Run the following SQL files to set up the required tables:
1. `supabase/ai_recommendations_schema.sql` (existing)
2. `supabase/persona_rag_schema.sql` (new)
