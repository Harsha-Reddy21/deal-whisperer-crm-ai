# Sample script for this file:
# "This is really impressive. As a physician, I can see how this would streamline 
# our clinical workflows significantly. The patient management interface looks 
# intuitive, and I appreciate the HIPAA compliance features you've built in. 
# My main concern is integration with our existing EHR systems - we use Epic 
# primarily. How seamless is that integration process? Also, can the AI features 
# help with clinical decision support without overstepping regulatory boundaries? 
# We need to be very careful about FDA compliance in our space."
