the "deals" feature, in the respective deal add button "customer objection" the user can add data. And the 'AI'(LLM) has to suggest convincing response. Make sure that the AI suggestions should be taken on the activities + description in the particular deal. If there is no descriipion and activites kindly say there is no data. 

add another button "deal coach" in the deal such that when user clicks it, the AI has to suggest next-steps to improve probabilty. The LLM has to take the other deals which are closed(loss/won) into consideration and give next steps to improve probability.

In the 'Leads' feature add button 'Persona' for every lead. It has to shown the behavior of the lead using all activities of the lead(interaction history). This button should be activated only when there is atleast one activity of the respective lead.

The 'smart lead' button should get the user input, based on that the ai has to query the best lead. Note that the llm has to query only the leads who has atleast one activity(interaction history)
