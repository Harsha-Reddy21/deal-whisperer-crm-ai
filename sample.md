Perfect â€” since you already have deals, contacts, and leads tables, and each includes data + precomputed embeddings, we can now build a hybrid search system that works like this:

âœ… Goal: Hybrid Search Across Deals, Contacts, Leads (+ their Activities)
You already have:
deals, contacts, leads: each with metadata + precomputed embeddings

activities: linked to each of the above entities

Embeddings stored either in the same table or in a separate vector index (e.g. pgvector column)

ðŸ§  Step-by-Step: Hybrid Search Flow
Step 1: Prepare Unified Embedding Entries (Already Done)
Each entry in deals, contacts, leads should have:

A column embedding (vector)

A type field (deal, contact, lead) if all records are in one table or index

Optionally: a combined_text field containing title + description + activities

Step 2: User Inputs a Natural Language Query
Example:

"Show me all leads from last month who had a call about pricing."

Step 3: Convert Query to an Embedding
python
Copy
Edit
query = "Show me all leads from last month who had a call about pricing."

query_embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=query
)["data"][0]["embedding"]
Step 4: Run Vector Search + Filter
Use pgvector (PostgreSQL) or Pinecone or another vector DB to search.

Example using pgvector in SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT id, type, name, description
FROM entities
WHERE type = 'lead'
  AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[your_query_embedding]'
LIMIT 10;
If your schema is not unified, run 3 queries (one for each table) and merge results.

Step 5: (Optional) Add Keyword Filtering
If you want extra precision, do fuzzy match or full-text search on combined_text:

sql
Copy
Edit
AND combined_text ILIKE '%pricing%'
Or use Postgres full-text search:

sql
Copy
Edit
AND to_tsvector('english', combined_text) @@ plainto_tsquery('pricing')
ðŸ“¦ Recommended Table Schema
If you're storing everything in one hybrid index:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE entities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('deal', 'contact', 'lead')),
  name TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  combined_text TEXT,
  embedding VECTOR(1536), -- or whatever your model outputs
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  metadata JSONB
);
