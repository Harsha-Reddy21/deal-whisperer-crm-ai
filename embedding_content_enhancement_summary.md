# Embedding Content Enhancement for Semantic Search

## Summary

We've enhanced the semantic search functionality to include the full text content used to generate embeddings in search results. This provides the LLM with comprehensive information about each entity, including all related activities, notes, and metadata, resulting in more accurate and detailed responses to user queries.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes

Modified three PostgreSQL functions to include the `embedding_content` field in their results:

- `search_similar_deals`
- `search_similar_contacts`
- `search_similar_leads`

These functions now return the full text content that was used to generate the embeddings, giving complete context for each entity.

### 2. TypeScript Interface Updates

Updated the `SemanticSearchResult` interface to include the `embeddingContent` field, which stores the full text content from the database.

File: `src/lib/ai/semanticSearch.ts`

### 3. Search Method Updates

Modified the semantic search methods to include the embedding content from the database in their results:

- `searchSimilarDeals`
- `searchSimilarContacts`
- `searchSimilarLeads`

### 4. LLM Context Formatting

Enhanced the `formatResultsForAI` function to include a new section with full content and activities for each search result. This provides the LLM with comprehensive information about each entity.

### 5. Testing

Created a test script to verify that embedding content is correctly included in search results:

File: `src/test/test_embedding_content.ts`

## Benefits

1. **More Complete Information**: The LLM now receives the full context for each entity, including all related activities and notes.

2. **No Extra Database Calls**: Since the content is returned with search results, no additional database calls are needed.

3. **Improved Response Quality**: With more comprehensive information, the LLM can provide more accurate, detailed, and relevant responses to user queries.

4. **Better Entity Understanding**: The LLM can better understand the relationships between entities, activities, and other data points.

## How to Verify

After applying the changes, the LLM responses should demonstrate a deeper understanding of the entities and their activities. For example, when asking about a deal related to OpenAI, the LLM will have access to all activities, notes, and details about that deal, resulting in more comprehensive and accurate responses.
